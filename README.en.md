# 📥 devscroll-contributions

This is the official **open contribution hub** for the [devscroll](https://github.com/devscroll) organization.

Here, you can submit **exercises**, **learning materials**, **practical challenges**, or any educational content related to programming and software development.

## 🤔 How does it work?

This repository acts as a **submission point**. You open a Pull Request (PR) with your contribution, and the devscroll team will review it, suggest improvements (if needed), and—if approved—move the content to the appropriate final repository within the organization.
